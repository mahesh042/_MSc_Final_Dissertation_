#Web-Based Bike Sharing Application

**Submitted By: Mahesh Srivinay Rayavarapu (msr31)**

This project is a web-based bike sharing application developed as part of my Masters dissertation. The application enables users to easily access and rent bicycles from nearby dock stations. It encompasses both front-end and back-end development, utilizing Django as the web framework, and integrates third-party APIs for secure payment processing and interactive map functionalities.

## Getting Started

To set up the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Python.
2. Install a Python source code editor (preferably VS Code).
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
